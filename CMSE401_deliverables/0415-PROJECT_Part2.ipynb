    "\n",
    "`pyro` is a software tool built in Python for modeling hydrodynamics Partial Differential Equations (PDEs). PDEs arise in many areas of physics and astronomy, including waves, transport, diffusion, heat, vibration, and even quantum mechanics. More specifically, PDEs can be used to model gravitational waves, magnetohydrodynamics, and radiative transport. As a computational tool, `pyro` could be useful in solvig a variety of astrophysical problems, especially as computational astrophysics grows as a field. Computational astrophysics can serve as a substitute for \"experimental\" astrophysics, since many astrophysical systems can not be reasonably reproduced in a laboratory setting. Furthermore, computational astrophysics serves as a bridge between theoretical predictions and observations. For this project, I cloned the repository to the HPCC and ran some of the serial code, then used `PyPy` to try and speed up the execution time. `PyPy` was unable to improve the execution time, with specific reasons for this discussed later."

    "Based on the results above, it is clear that `PyPy` was ineffective at speeding up the `pyro` code. One reason for this is that `PyPy` is most effective on longer-running code. Although all of the examples shown here are iterative/looping processes, all finished in less than 10 minutes, meaning that the overhead involved with `PyPy` caused more harm than good.\n",
    "\n",
    "Across the entire timing study, running with the `tophat` inputs tended to produce faster execution times than the `smooth` inputs. The `advection_weno` solver was also the slowest by far, taking roughly 2 minutes (serial) or 8 minutes (`PyPy`) to run in some cases. The only time the `tophat` inputs did not outperform the `smooth` inputs was with the `advection_weno` solver.\n",

    "Futhermore, in all cases, the ordering of execution time (from slowest to fastest) was `css-059/css-124`, `k20`, `k80`, and `v100`. This makes sense, as the newer hardware on newer development nodes led to faster execution times. The added overhead of submitting a job to the cluster may have contributed to the slow performance of the `css` nodes. If the nodes used older hardware, that could also explain the slower performance. "

    "`pyro` is a programming tool that can be used to solve hydrodynamics PDEs that appear in a variety of astrophysical situations. An attempt to speed it up with `PyPy` was unsuccessful. This is most likely because the `pyro` examples tested take less than 10 minutes to run, which is likely not long enough for `PyPy` to match or improve upon the serial results.\n",
    "\n",
    "If we wanted to use `PyPy` to improve the results, we would need to run the code for much longer -- something more on the order of hours. At those scales, the speed-up capabilities of `PyPy` may overcome the overhead costs. As an alternative to `PyPy`, we could use another drop-in compiler like `Cython`/`CPython`. We could also try expanding upon `pyro`'s current `numba` implementation, as `numba` is only used in a few of the solvers, none of which were featured here."
